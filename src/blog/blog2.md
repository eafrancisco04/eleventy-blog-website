Naturally, this blog is all about why sunscreen is important for your skin. There are many reasons why people should add sunscreen to their daily routine. It is both for aesthetic purposes and health actually. The beach isn't the only time that you need it because you are still under the sun when you're at the city. The effect may not seem that noticeable but over time, the UV rays from the sun will cause longterm damage that can only be fixed by a doctor. In a lot of cases, it can even lead to skin cancer and such. However, this is just an intro, so no need to get into too much detail on that in this section.

#### Sun Protection

Protection from the sun is really the biggest benefit to sunscreen, so it should be on the top of the list. When making listicles, always put the most important one at the top, or at least that's how I feel. What some people do is make the most important one at the end so that readers will stay. However, I think that's crazy, and you will end up losing a lot more readers with this way of organizing your blog posts.
#### Discoloration

Okay, this one is kind of cheating since it's also kind of the same as the last bullet point. Sun damage also causes pigmentation and discoloration, which is why you can develop dark spots or patches on your skin that are a different shade. Again, this is kind of a health thing too. But for the sake of having a list, let's make it into its own thing to give you a reason to actually write this.

#### Hydration

Excessive sun exposure can increase signs of aging on the skin. This is because moisture is lost because of direct contact with the sun's rays. Sunscreen is an extra layer of protection and helps keep moisture in your face. It also supports the properties of other skincare products you used under it.
